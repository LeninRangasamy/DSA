# Bubble sort problems
# Level 1 — Fundamentals

1️⃣ Count Swaps

Problem: 
Given an array, use Bubble Sort to:

-Sort the array

-Count total number of swaps


 Tests:

- Understanding of swap logic

- Loop control



---

2️⃣ Already Sorted Check

Problem:
Modify Bubble Sort to print:

- "Already Sorted" if no swaps occur

- "Sorting Required" otherwise


 Tests:

- swapped flag usage



---

3️⃣ Print After Each Pass

Problem:
Print the array after each outer loop pass, not after every comparison.

Tests:

- Difference between pass and iteration



---

# Level 2 — Optimization Thinking

4️⃣ Optimized Bubble Sort

Problem:
Implement Bubble Sort using:

-  swapped flag

- size - i - 1 inner loop optimization


 Tests:

- Best-case time complexity understanding



---

5️⃣ Last Swap Optimization

Problem:
Track the last swapped index and reduce comparisons in the next pass.

 Tests:

- Advanced optimization

- Reducing unnecessary comparisons



---

6️⃣ Sort in Descending Order

Problem:
Modify Bubble Sort to sort the array in descending order.

Tests:

- Comparison logic understanding



---

# Level 3 — Logic & Analysis

7️⃣ Minimum Passes Required

Problem:
Given an array, determine how many passes Bubble Sort needs to fully sort it.

 Tests:

- Understanding of element movement



---

8️⃣ Detect Nearly Sorted Array

Problem:
Return true if an array can be sorted in one pass of Bubble Sort.

 Tests:

- Swap detection

-  Real-world optimization



---

9️⃣ Bubble Sort for Strings

Problem:
Sort an array of strings using Bubble Sort (alphabetical order).

Tests:

- String comparison logic



---

# Level 4 — Interview Challenges

🔟 Stable Sort Verification

Problem:
Given objects with {value, originalIndex}, prove Bubble Sort is stable by implementation.

Tests:

- Stability concept

- Real interview question



---

1️⃣1️⃣ Find K-th Largest Using Bubble Sort

Problem:
Without fully sorting, find the K-th largest element using Bubble Sort logic.

Tests:

- Partial sorting

- Algorithm efficiency



---

1️⃣2️⃣ Bubble Sort Visualization

Problem:
- Print the array such that:

- Swapped elements are highlighted

- Each pass is clearly labeled


 Tests:

- Algorithm tracing

- Debugging skills
